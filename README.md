# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains passenger information (class, sex, age, fare, survival status).  
We used this dataset to explore survival rates by different factors.

## Visualizations
Below are the generated charts:

![Survival by Sex and Class]
![Age Distribution by Survival]
![Age Boxplot by Class]
![Fare Violin by Class]
![Age vs Fare]
![Correlation Heatmap]

## Key Insights
- **Females survived at higher rates than males**, especially in 1st and 2nd class.
- **Class strongly influenced survival** — first-class passengers had higher survival and higher fares.
- **Age matters** — younger passengers show slightly higher survival densities.
- **Fare distributions are skewed** — first-class fares have long right tails.
